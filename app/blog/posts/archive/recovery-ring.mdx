Recently I sprained my back. You would think that I sprained it from something cool like a jujitsu spar. But no, it got sprained through moving too dynamically playing **ultimate frisbee** out of all sports. I spent every week after that visiting a physical therapist to do rehab exercises. This got me thinking - I got injured from my sheer ignorance, from my lack of warm up, from straining my muscles in a way that ultimately led to injury. There must be a way to prevent this from happening in the first place. 

I've realized that creating something more hardware related could be a really promising avenue.
