Hi. This is my personal repo that I use to keep track of essentially my career. 

I love writing. Writing makes my day better. I'm perpetually busy, but I believe I'll eventually make time to write as I believe it's a large part of becoming a good engineer! I learned from my mentors that if I was to win the lottery the next day and leave my job (not that I would lol), or the dark version of that is go to a car crash, what's left of me is my digital footprint.
